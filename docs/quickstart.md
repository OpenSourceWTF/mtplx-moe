# Quickstart

Install the OpenSourceWTF fork directly from GitHub. It is not published to
PyPI or the upstream Homebrew tap.

```bash
python3 -m pip install "mtplx @ git+https://github.com/OpenSourceWTF/mtplx-moe.git@main"

mtplx help
mtplx doctor --summary
mtplx pull Youssofal/Qwen3.6-27B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed
mtplx inspect Youssofal/Qwen3.6-27B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed --json
```

The upstream Homebrew formula, PyPI package, Mac app, and official release
artifacts do not install this fork.

The commands above are no-MLX-safe except generation and serving. A missing MLX runtime should appear in `doctor` as an actionable dependency issue, not a traceback.

After the verified model is available:

```bash
mtplx start
mtplx start cli
mtplx start cli --no-mtp
mtplx quickstart --port 8000 --no-stats-footer
```

`--no-mtp` switches generation to target-only AR. For MTP-equipped models the
MTP runtime stays loaded, so terminal chat can use `/mtp off`, `/mtp on`, and
`/mtp status` without reloading. Native AR-only models such as
`mlx-community/Laguna-S-2.1-oQ4e` instead install an unloaded AR route at
construction because there is no MTP head to retain.

The Laguna download is pinned automatically. It needs about 64.13 GB of disk
space and at least 96 GiB unified memory; 128 GiB is recommended. Its default
context and maximum response are 32,768 tokens. A larger explicit server
context is accepted only when it fits the active Metal resident-memory cap.

Use `mtplx doctor --deep --json` for exhaustive diagnostics and `mtplx doctor --bundle` to create a redacted support bundle.
